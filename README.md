# tcecTwitchGI

TCEC Graphical Interface for Twitch streams.

A web page intended to be run locally, which is supposed to lift the PGN from the TCEC website and relay the games + information in a cool visual presentation, meant to then be captured and broadcast over Twitch.

Still in the early stages.

It uses the pgn4web library (http://pgn4web.casaschi.net/) and Web Ticker (https://github.com/mazedigital/Web-Ticker)
