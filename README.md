# tcecTwitchGI

TCEC Graphical Interface for Twitch streams.

Demo: http://tcec-twitch-test.surge.sh/stream.html (designed for a 1920x1080 resolution displayed full screen)

A web page intended to be run locally, which is supposed to lift the PGN from the TCEC website and relay the games + information in a cool visual presentation, meant to then be captured and broadcast over Twitch.

Still in the early stages. Needs all the JS magic.

It uses the pgn4web library (http://pgn4web.casaschi.net/) and Web Ticker (https://github.com/mazedigital/Web-Ticker)
